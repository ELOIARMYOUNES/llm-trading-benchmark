# Qualitative Analysis (Video Walkthrough)

This folder provides **qualitative evidence** showing differences between LLM outputs
for the trading benchmark.

Key points:

- Many LLMs produce fluent but generic technical confirmations.
- Only **Gemini** and **Gemma** consistently reference **correct price levels** 
  from both chart images and OHLCV data.
- The video walkthrough demonstrates these differences side-by-side.

See `grounded_vs_generic.md` for concrete examples, and watch the video using the link in `video_link.md`.
